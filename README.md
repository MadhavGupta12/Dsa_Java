# Dsa_Java

This repository contains my solutions and practice code for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java**.  
It covers important topics like arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, recursion, and sorting algorithms.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- `Arrays/` â€“ Basic array problems  
- `Strings/` â€“ String manipulation problems  
- `LinkedList/` â€“ Singly & Doubly Linked List implementations  
- `Trees/` â€“ Binary Tree & BST problems  
- `Graphs/` â€“ BFS, DFS, and graph algorithms  
- `Sorting/` â€“ Sorting techniques (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)
